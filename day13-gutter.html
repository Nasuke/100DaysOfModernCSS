        Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing
        machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental
        insurance. Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose
        leisurewear
        and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and
        wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing,
        spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it
        all,
        pissing your last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you
        spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that?
        I
        chose not to choose life. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when
        you've got heroin?
