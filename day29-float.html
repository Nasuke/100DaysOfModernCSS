        <blockquote>The Danube (/ˈdæn.juːb/ DAN-yoob; known by various names in other languages) is a river that was
            once a
            long-standing frontier of the Roman Empire and today connects 10 European countries, running through their
            territories or being a border. Originating in Germany, the Danube flows southeast for 2,850 km (1,770 mi),
            passing through or bordering Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, and
            Ukraine before draining into the Black Sea. Its drainage basin extends into nine more countries. The largest
            cities on the river are Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade and Bratislava, all of which are the capitals of their
            respective countries. The Danube passes through four capital cities, more than any other river in the
            world.[8]
            Five more capital cities lie in the Danube's basin: Bucharest, Sofia, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Sarajevo. The
            fourth-largest city in its basin is Munich, the capital of Bavaria, standing on the Isar River.</blockquote>
