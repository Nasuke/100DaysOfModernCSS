        当内部的滚动区域滚动到底部以后 如果再滚那outer的区域也会开始滚动 
        这种情况有时不是我们期望的
        我们希望滚动不会像一条链 各自独立
        那就可以用 overscroll-behavior: none;

            And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this<br>
            But I'ma drop it at a higher level<br>
            'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns<br>
            Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game<br>
            But I learned to burn that bridge and delete<br>
            Those who compete at a level that's obsolete<br>
            Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag<br>
            To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all<br>
            See through the news and the views that twist reality<br>
            Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny<br>
            Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns<br>
            Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn
        </div>

        <p>
            With the thoughts from a militant mind<br>
            Hardline, hardline after hardline<br>
            Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns<br>
            Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn (Yes, you're gonna)<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>
            Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn<br>

        <p>
            It goes a one, two, three, another funky, radical bombtrack<br>
            Started as a sketch in my notebook<br>
            And now dope hooks make punks take another look<br>
            My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear<br>
            That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
